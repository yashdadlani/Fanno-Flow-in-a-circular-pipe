Air enters a circular pipe of dimensions L = 5 m and D = 4 cm at T1 = 300 K, p1 = 1 bar, u1 = 696 m/s. Assume that the flow can be approximated as a Fanno flow. If f = 10^(-3) and R = 288 J/kg/K, is there choking and if so, is there a change in the mass flow rate in the pipe? Plot the variation of all quantities from the set {p, œÅ, T,u, M, p0} along the entire pipe length.
